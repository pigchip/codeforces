# Codeforces Exercises Repository

Hello there! This repository contains my journey and progress in solving problems from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/).

## Repository Structure

- `solutions/`: Directory containing solutions, divided by contest divisions (`div1/`, `div2/`, `div3/`). Under each division, problems are categorized by labels like A, B, C, etc. Each problem has its own folder with the solution (`main.cpp`) and a problem-specific README.
- `utils/`: Contains utility files and scripts that assist in my coding journey.

## Executing Solutions

I primarily use the terminal for executing my solutions. Here's the general approach:

1. Navigate to the specific problem directory. For example:

   ```bash
   cd solutions/div2/A/problem-name1/
   ```

2. Compile the solution:

   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o solution
   ```

3. Run the compiled code:

   ```bash
   ./solution
   ```

## Utility Files

- `template.cpp`: A basic template I often start my solutions with, located in the `utils/` directory. It includes commonly used headers and often-used snippets to save time.

## Progress

Being a beginner, I'm currently focusing on:

- [ ] Div2 A Problems
- [ ] Div2 B Problems
- [ ] Getting comfortable with C++ STL

Any feedback, suggestions, or coding tips are highly appreciated!
